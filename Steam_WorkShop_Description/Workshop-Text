Do you like fashion? This mutator is for you! Free Masks, Backpacks & Special FX added to the trader shop! Well.. not free but just for the price of 5 Fucking Dosh mate!!!

You ask, what is the difference between this and the other versions? Well: 

- This doesn't require ServerPerks at all!
- All Masks, backpacks and effects cost 5 Dosh instead of 100! Now you can look sexy or fugly in HoE for almost no cost!
- Full mutator base-code change. Much more clean and simple. 

Special thanks to:

- [C|AK]|[Forever] ( Originally making the mutator)
- no7sag for adding new masks
- Me for actually fixing the 'Mutator' part, and removing 'ServerPerks' requirements!
- All items are listed under the 'Off-Perk' weapons in the trader (Where you find the ZED weapons)
